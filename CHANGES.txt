Changelog
=========

0.10 (2009-03-22)
-----------------

- Do not remove attributes from classes when reloading. ZCML directives and
  other wiring is liable to add attributes to class that will then disappear
  on reload. This means that if you have removed a class attribute, it will
  *not* disappear on reload. In this case: restart. :)

0.9 (2008-07-23)
----------------

- Removed the manual cleanup approach for extra registries populated by ZCML
  parsing. Instead we use the registry of cleanup functions inside
  zope.testing.cleanup to automatically pick up all cleaning functions.

0.8 (2008-06-30)
----------------

- Wrap the setupFinalLogging method of the Zope2 starter objects to initialize
  our internal modified times registry once after Zope is finished loading.
  This is the closest I could find that resembles a `Zope is finished loading`
  event and should help to remove the double-reload behavior.

- Only expose the reload view in Zope 2 development mode.
  [hannosch]

- In case of errors during ZCML reload, restore the original global site
  manager state, instead of leaving it in a broken state. This allows you to
  fix and retry the ZCML reload as many times as you need.

0.7 (2008-06-17)
----------------

- Merged the two distinct views into one called @@reload. Added a somewhat
  nicer UI to it and explain some of the current limitations on that page.
  [hannosch]

- Refactored ZCML loading code a bit. Always do an automatic code reload
  before reloading ZCML.
  [hannosch]

- Removed all blacklisting code.
  [hannosch]


0.6 (2008-06-11)
----------------

- Disabled blacklist until it can be made configurable. The speedup is hardly
  noticeable anyway, and it can block too much (especially if plone.reload
  is being used in a lib/python style deployment rather than as an egg).
  [optilude]


0.5 (2008-05-24)
----------------

- Merged r20 from http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~refreshng-dev/refreshng/dev.
  This fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/refreshng/+bug/175898.
  [hannosch]

- Removed various levels of caching which turned out to be premature and
  caused lots of modules not to be found.
  [hannosch]


0.4 (2008-03-01)
----------------

- Made the code reload available as its own @@code_reload view.
  [hannosch]

- Integrated xreload.py from RefreshNG and added a first working version of a
  general manual code reload feature.
  [hannosch]


0.3 (2008-02-21)
----------------

- Fixed caching issues by invalidating all ZODB caches. If you have local site
  managers spread across multiple FileStorages this might still not work as
  expected.
  [hannosch]

- Added cleanup for CMFCore and PAS.
  [hannosch]


0.2 (2008-01-25)
----------------

- Added compatibility with Zope 2.10 / Plone 3.0.
  [hannosch]


0.1 (2008-01-25)
----------------

- Initial implementation based heavily on Products.RefreshNG.
  [hannosch]

- Initial package structure.
